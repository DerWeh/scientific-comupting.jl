# Automatic differentiation from scratch

Derivatives are ubiquitous in physics, take stress, strain, heat capacity, expansion coefficients, or response functions in general.
Furthermore, they are a useful tool for optimization problems.

This notebook shows a naive minimal implementation of automatic differentiation in Julia.
But let's first start out with the traditional approaches and their limitations.

# Finite differences

Let's start with the school book definition of a derivative:

```math
	\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}
	= \lim_{h \rightarrow \infty} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
```

The numerical evaluation seems straight forward: just use a small value ``h``.
This is called *finite difference*, as we use a finite value of ``h``.

We use the symmetric central difference

```math
	\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}
	\approx  \frac{f(x+\frac{h}{2}) - f(x-\frac{h}{2})}{h}:
```

In general, finite differences have problems with numerical inaccuracies and instabilities, especially when calculating higher order derivatives.
Finite difference become slow, when calculating gradients with respect to many inputs.

Some packages offer to calculate numerical derivates using integration employing the *residue theorem* instead, to avoid numerical inaccuracies, see e.g. [mpmath's `method='quad'`](https://www.mpmath.org/doc/current/calculus/differentiation.html#numerical-derivatives-diff-diffs).
While calculating analytical integrations is hard and differentiation is simple,
numerically it's the other way around: integrating is quite simple while differentiations becomes hard.

# Symbolic differentiation

Symbolic differentiation calculates the analytic derivative of functions using symbolic computation.
This is like the pen-and-paper version of doing derivatives.

We'll use the [Symbolics.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/Symbolics/stable/) computer algebra system.

# Automatic differentiation

Automatic differentiation is the modern solution: We evaluate the derivative along with the function without building the function graph.

To implement this we define dual numbers, keeping track of the derivative along with the current value.

We have to tell Julia how to do math with dual numbers.
So let's tell it what an addition is.
In addition to adding numbers, we have to implement the differentiation rules.
Differentiation is linear

```math
	\frac{\partial(af + bg)}{\partial x} 
	= a \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + b \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}.
```

Our definition of dual numbers brings already the termination condition for the chain rule to the table:

```math
	\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}
	= f'(x) \frac{\partial x}{\partial x} = f'(x) \cdot 1.
```
We explicitly passed in the ``1``.
So let's add the method for dual numbers to the `+` function:

Of course, we need the rest of the mathematical operations to do meaningful calculus.

	\frac{\partial (fg)}{\partial x}
	= \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} g + f \frac{\partial g}{\partial x}

This is a good point to remember how magic generic programming can be.
Our definition of `Dual` was generic with respect to the data type, so far we only used `Float64`, but it works just es well for other precisions like `Float32`, arbitrary precision (`BigFLoat`), and even symbols!
By implementing automatic differentiation, we get symbolic differentiation for free!

This is quite useful to validate our implementation.

In general, the error depends on ``f'''(x)``.
Assuming that the function and its third derivative are on a similar scale, the error is minimal for ``h = \sqrt[3]{\frac{ϵ}{2}}``.
As we only use rough numbers, we should not be over-precise and rather drop the factor ``2``.
Thus, a good default choice for the step size ``h`` is

## Forward vs. reverse mode

The dual number approach we used is a *forward mode* automatic differentiation, also called *tangent mode*.
We push the (augmented) inputs through the function in the same order we evaluate the functions.
It is very natural to implement, but for a function 
```math
	f: \mathbb{R}^n -> \mathbb{R}^m
```
we need $n$ sweeps.
Each sweep generates one column of the Jacobian matrix
```math
	\boldsymbol{J}_{\boldsymbol{f}}
	\coloneqq \begin{pmatrix}
		\frac{\partial\boldsymbol{f}}{\partial x_1}
		& \dots
		& \frac{\partial\boldsymbol{f}}{\partial x_n}
	\end{pmatrix}
	= \begin{pmatrix}
		\boldsymbol{\nabla}^\mathsf{T} f_1
		\\ \vdots
		\\ \boldsymbol{\nabla}^\mathsf{T} f_m
	\end{pmatrix}.
```
